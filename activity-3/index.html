            The PlayStation 4 (officially abbreviated as PS4) is Sony's most powerful gaming console to date. It is an eighth generation home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The PlayStation 4 serves up dazzling graphics, runs on a simplified and logical interface and boasts a fantastic
            controller. It has the upper hand in indie games and can stream a constantly growing list of legacy titles via
            PlayStation Now. The PS4 makes it super-easy to capture and broadcast gameplay online and generally delivers a zippier
            performance than its direct competition. The console's back has a standard, if slightly spare, set of ports: HDMI, Ethernet, optical audio out, and a proprietary
            socket for the optional PlayStation Camera. It's really what's on the inside that counts, of course, and what's inside this box is impressive. The PlayStation 4 has
            a custom processor with eight AMD Jaguar CPU cores, and a next-gen Radeon GPU. It also doubles as a Blu-ray player and solid media-streaming box. Of course, you won't be spending your time with the PlayStation 4 staring at a box. You'll be interacting with the new
            DualShock 4 wireless controller, which is easily the best gamepad Sony has ever built. Since the DualShock 4 now uses a Micro USB port, you can juice the controller’s rechargeable battery with a smartphone
            or tablet charger, or even hook it up to a PC. What's really impressive, though, is the standard 3.5mm headset jack. Not
            only can you use the included mono headset for voice chat, but you can also plug in any old pair of headphones and route
            the entire system's audio through the controller. The PlayStation 4 easily impresses and justifies its success in the market. The base hardware provides a
            satisfyingly powerful platform and features Sony’s most ergonomic controller yet. The PlayStation interface is fast and
            uncomplicated, and grants access to the content you want with a minimum of hassle. Most everything a gamer upgrading from the previous generation could want or has come to expect is here, but there are
            only a couple of truly cool new features beyond that—just Share Play and streaming—and the absence of some media
            partners and restrictions on media access means there will sometimes be things you want that you can’t find on PS4. As it stands now, the PlayStation 4 continues to be an impressive console that’s expanding with
            gamers in just the way they want, particularly with regard to sharing and streaming features
